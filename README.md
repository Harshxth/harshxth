PROJECT EXPERIENCE				       		                                       November 2021 - August 2025
Hospital Length of Stay Prediction - Machine Learning
	•	Developed a predictive model for hospital length of stay using100,000 patient records, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.30 days (±7.1 hours) with XGBoost.
	•	Systematically evaluated12+ machine learning algorithms and230+ hyperparameter configurations, demonstrating5-6x improvement over published research benchmarks.
	•	Delivered actionable insights with potential cost savings of $1.7-2.6M annually per400-bed hospital by optimizing hospital length of stay predictions.
AI Travel bot - Generative AI 
	•	Built an AI tourism chatbot for a travel company using the OpenAI API and PHP, with prompt design and custom wrappers for itinerary planning, booking help, and local recommendations.
	•	Increased potential clients from the website by improving lead capture and conversions after chatbot deployment.
3D Scene Reconstruction with NeRF - Machine Learning
	•	Built a NeRF-based system that reconstructs a 3D scene from a small set of 2D images and renders realistic new viewpoints using positional encoding and volumetric rendering.
	•	Optimized training for sparse image inputs to improve efficiency while maintaining photorealistic quality in novel view synthesis.
